## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API Key

## Explanation of code

This Python script utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo engine through the OpenAI API to generate text based on user prompts. Here's how the code works:

- **Setting up OpenAI API Key**: You need to set up your OpenAI API key in the script before running it. This key enables access to the GPT-3.5 engine for text generation.

- **User Prompt Input**: The script prompts the user to enter a prompt for the chatbot. This prompt can be a question, statement, or any text that you want the chatbot to respond to.

- **Generating Text with GPT-3.5**: Using the provided prompt, the script sends a request to the OpenAI API, specifying the GPT-3.5 Turbo engine for text generation. The `max_tokens` parameter controls the maximum length of the generated text.

- **Displaying Generated Text**: Once the API responds with the generated text, the script prints it to the console, providing the user with the chatbot's response.

- **Adjusting Parameters**: Users can adjust the `max_tokens` parameter in the script to control the length of the generated text. This parameter allows customization based on specific requirements.

By following these steps, users can quickly generate text prompts for chatbots using advanced AI capabilities provided by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo engine.
